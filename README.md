# Distance_Tracking_Device
 GPS distance tracking device integrated with Google maps and Folium API using TIVA C microcontroller. The project uses Tiva C tm4c123gh6pm to calculate the total distance moved using ublox neo 6ms GPS module showing it on LCD and turning on the LED after 100 meters, it also shows the distance traveled on the map. The project uses layered architecture.
